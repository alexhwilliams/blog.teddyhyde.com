Great companies have notable company cultures: Zappos. Google. Even companies which have undesirable company cultures (Oracle) have cultures which fit their ways of being.

We are a communication company first and foremost. Communication is widely misunderstood. When you ask most people whether they are good communicators, they will almost always say yes. And they will then attempt to convince you that they can relay facts better than most people. But relaying facts never moved mountains or people. The root of the word communication is "commune." Communication is all about connection, and without deliberate practice, ironically, you are rarely a good communicator naturally. Connecting is a different skill than relating facts. It takes work in the spiritual realm more than the intellectual realm.

## You cannot have culture without the cult

If we are not constantly reinforcing and developing our culture deliberately, then we are developing our culture accidentally. If we are building things blind to our culture, then we are building our culture accidentally. So, when creating anything, it must be within a larger discussion of "what are we building with this?"

Many mothers are fearful of cults. There are bad aspects of cults, like isolation and rigid minded opinions. As a communication company we should deliberately work to connect with people authentically, accept others for who they are inside and outside of our company, and seek understanding and integration when dealing with people. Being aware of the downsides of harmful cults is beneficial and a good teachable experience.

And, like a cult, if we are not laughed at for what we practice then we are defaulting our culture to the status quo. If we are not struggling with what we are building spiritually, then we are not developing our humanity and our company. A cult takes deliberate difficult work. Of course, living outside a framework of love and development is actually harder, though our subconscious tries to make it sound easier.

## Make communication flow

What are the things that make communication difficult within modern societies? The communication revolution has had the opposite effect on most people's productivity: more email makes it harder to get things done. Delegating is not sending a disorganized email. This layers more junk onto people.

How do we do this within a technical company? Testing is vital: new people can start hacking without disturbing the flow of others. Adding a new engineer does not make all the other engineers learn a new coding style, a new documentation style. You get trust for free. Read more about testing in our testing document.

Go into any bathroom at Google and you will see testing strategies in the uniral walls. You should be thinking tests even when peeing. As you expunge physically you will be clearing and cleansing your thought processes as well.

## Know thyself.

We cannot develop a culture without truly knowing ourselves. We cannot truly know ourselves without being objective about our habits and practices. There many ways to learn about ourselves: writing (blogging), a foundation of our company, is an easy and hard way to learn and reflect.

## Measure everything

Once we have objective measurement, we can effectively analyze and measure ourselves. Companies in the new world will succeed or die by their ability to measure and adapt. 

Measurement leads to the direction of adaptation. Tests lead to the ability to adapt.

## Everyone is an engineer

This is not a place for people frightened of engineering. Being an engineer is more of a declaration than an ability. An engineer is:

* someone willing to constantly learn new skills
* someone willing to say they don't know and figure out how to do it.
* someone who says it will take this much time for me to do it rather than it cannot be done

all of these things are cultural traits not intellectual traits. Emotional stabilities rather than intellectual groundings.
