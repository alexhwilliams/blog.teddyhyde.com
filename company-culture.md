Great companies have notable company cultures: Zappos. Google. Even companies which have undesirable company cultures (Oracle) have cultures which fit their ways of being.

We are a communication company first and foremost. Communication is widely misunderstood. When you ask most people whether they are good communicators, they will almost always say yes. And they will then attempt to convince you that they can relay facts better than most people. But relaying facts never moved mountains or people. The root of the word communication is "commune." Communication is all about connection, and without deliberate practice, ironically, you are rarely a good communicator naturally. Connecting is a different skill than relating facts. It takes work in the spiritual realm more than the intellectual realm.

## Measure everything

This manifests itself in our company technically by usage of tests.
