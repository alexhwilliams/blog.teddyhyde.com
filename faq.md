# Frequently Asked Questions
 
*Can I edit files other than markdown with Teddy Hyde?*

Yes! Teddy Hyde will allow you to open, edit and save any file. Even images. But, you probably don't want to do that.

*How are images handled?*

Teddy Hyde makes some assumptions about handling images.

1. If Teddy Hyde uploads the image, it puts it in assets/images with the file name as the date.
2. Teddy Hyde will store a thumbnail, resized image and the original. 
3. You can insert any of those three sizes from the menu when editing a post or page.
