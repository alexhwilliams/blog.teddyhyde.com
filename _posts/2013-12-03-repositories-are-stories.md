If you are not a software engineer, a hacker, then you probably have no clue what a  repository is. 

It is the story of a piece of art.

Git, in my opinion, is the best way to record that story.

It is a story that can include and invite collaborators easily, in a way no art has ever permitted before.

And, it is a story that can transform (fork) in many ways, often without permission.

Repositories teach you how to make art. They invite you into the mind of an artist like no other story before.

Repositories are stories about art in the modern world.
