# Can Teddy Hyde achieve parity with WordPress for Android? #

Teddy Hyde has almost everything here. Posts and pages. Which things are missing?

## The editor ##

## Special formatting options ##

Teddy Hyde has most of these. And, markdown can easily be entered by hand if missing from a menu.

Plus, you get a nice preview feature just a swipe away.

## Image support ##

Teddy Hyde will publish images right into your repository. And, provide you with the original image, and thumbnail and a resized image great for mobile devices.

# Going beyond parity #

Hyde Transformations are, in my opinion, the coolest thing about Teddy Hyde. You can extend your editor with a little bit of JSON code checked in to your repository.

# The Future #

Teddy Hyde is open source. Fork it on Github! And, these are the things I want to do in the short term.

1. Preferences page
2. Long press to toggle YFM (YAML Front Matter) publish state.
3. YFM editor.

What do you want in your editor?
