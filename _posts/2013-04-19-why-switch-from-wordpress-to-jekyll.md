# A new page #

WordPress is awful. It is no longer a pig with lipstick. It is a snarling warthog with Michael Jackson's plastic surgeon on retainer. I know warthogs, living for a short while more in the deep South.

Why?

PHP.

I could really stop right there. But, let's go on.

## Plugins ##

One of myths about WordPress is that there is a plugin for everything. The truth is there is a badly written plugin for everything.

There are standards for plugin development. And, sometimes developers follow them. Would you buy a Honda which randomly included parts from a Trabant only 13% of the time? This is what you get with WordPress plugins.

Quality is not the only issue. Performance is a big problem with these plugins and this is why companies like WPEngine have arisen. But, their business model requires lock-in and my experience is they cannot often solve big issues any better than rolling up your sleeves yourself.

## Google needs dynamic page generation. Your blog doesn't ##

Almost every made to Google is unique. So, they need to return a different page git each set of search terms that are entered. Even so, they cache and serve pages as much add possible.

Your blog is often returning the same content to each visitor. But, it is doing very expensive lookups in a database for each request and this is not necessary. WordPress has a plugin for helping you with this, but see the note on plugins above.

Jekyll is a completely static blog once it is on your server. There are dynamic things you can do before you upload everything, like applying layouts. But there is no database. This lack of complexity makes your life as as blogger better.
