upload images.

grid view is ugly but usable.

would be nice to add support for an image hosting service.

resizes into three sizes: original, resized (200 width by 200, aspect ratio maintained) and thumbnail.

resize looks poor to me, perhaps there is a better image transform algorithm i could use.

works with Hyde transforms.
