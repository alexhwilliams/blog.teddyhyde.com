Well, you can upload images! And, Teddy Hyde will upload a resized version (200x200 with aspect ratio maintained) and a thumbnail.

You are presented with theses images as a grid view. This grid view is ugly but usable.

I would really like to add support and integration for an image hosting service.

Resize looks poor to me, perhaps there is a better image transform algorithm i could use.

Images work with Hyde transforms, meaning if you specify type as image in your transform, you can prompt for an image, and when you choose it, insert it wrapped with some extra text, or modify the link using a Regexp.
