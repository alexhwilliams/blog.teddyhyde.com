While expecting our first child, I occilated between exuberance and terror. I was so excited to be a father. But, deep down, I was thinking: "Is this the end of my career as a software developer? Are my long periods of focus and solitude necessary for creativity gone for the next eighteen years? Will I soon be what I despise, a suited middle manager with bad eyesight?"

I was wrong. Four months into fatherhood I am experiencing some of my most creative moments. I do have less time to write software. But, the moments between when I am with my son (he is sleeping on my chest as I write this now) offer me pause and quiet to be present and think, and this makes my output better more satisfying.

Here are a few more reasons.

1. When you make something, your child will force you to take breaks. Prior to my son, I would often work long sessions without stopping and looking back I can see the quality of my work suffered.
2. I am coding less and thinking more. Without breaks I was banging away like a monkey and the results were about that quality. Now I have to spend more time thinking about a problem without a distraction machine (computer) in front of me.
3. I am more focused when I do work because I am not focused on work all the time. I want to be fully present when I am with my son and being out of work in my head with him helps me when I am in it.
4. parenting is one of the most physical things i have ever done. You walk all over with a child. No more sitting at a computer screen for twelve hours. being physical is part and parcel of being creative.

I knew about the benefits to doing all these things. But, I did not do them. My son forced me to do them, for the first time in a long while.
