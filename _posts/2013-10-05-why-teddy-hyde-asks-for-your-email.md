*TL;DR* : **We promise to never spam you or share your email address. We collect your email for a few technical reasons and pledge never to send you email without getting your explicit permission first. With one exception (read below for details). And, we are building a way to remove the email from the system.**

The other day I was working with Alex Williams and he was trying out my new service Teddy Hyde for Jekyll blogging. He tweeted that he was trying it out and several people have retweeted with feedback on Twitter regarding using it.

I think I finally my understand why twitter is so interesting to so many people, and even more so, companies. Previously, I always thought that Twitter was something to look at, get distracted by the multiple conversations and lose several hours. Distraction might be my biggest problem these days. But once before people started tweeting about the service and I started responding I got to see that perhaps twitter is like a living, conversational documentation system. I see value in that.

One of the questions that came up was: why do you ask for an email address? The answer is technical in nature, but the implications are not technical for this user.

Briefly, I generally ask for email addresses when people log in using social Loggins like GitHub or Facebook or Twitter, because it allows me to associate another account coming from a different authorization service automatically. Another words, if you login you get hub and then you log into your Facebook and you have the same email address in your account I know you are the same person. This is somewhat of a challenging problem and it makes it easier I ask for the address up front. And, Teddy Hyde generates a blog for you and the blog configuration file has an email field, and the service automatically wires this in for you. I should make this optional or at least make users aware of this "feature."

For this user, however, I understood that this was an issue of privacy. What am I going to do with this email address? Will I be spamming them? These are very valid questions.

So to put in writing, I want to say to tell you that Teddy Hyde *will never spam you and will never share your email address that we collect*. That is a promise.
