This is from the neocities blog. I love what is said here.


> This is why my goal with NeoCities is not to turn it into a GeoCities parody site, though I don't really care if people use it that way. The purpose of this project is not to inspire nostalgia. It's to rebuild the platform for us to be able to be creative again. To have sites that we can do whatever we want with. This is not nostalgia speaking. We really did lose our platforms for creativity and rich self expression online, and I want to help bring them back.

Well put.
