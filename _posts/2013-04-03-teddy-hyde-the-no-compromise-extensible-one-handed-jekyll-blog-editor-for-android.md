# Teddy Hyde?

Did you know Teddy was a nickname for Edward that gained popularity in the Victorian era, right when "The curious case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was set? Did you know Mr. Hyde's first name in the story was Edward? Hyde and Jekyll are perfect complements, both in the story and when blogging.

# No compromises?

I wanted to make a first class editor for my phone. Many have accused the iPad of being only a consumption device. I think I agree. But, I think we can make cool creation tools for handheld devices.

# One handed?

When my son was born four months ago, I felt very challenged blogging, to say nothing about programming. Little babies like to be held. So, I wanted to make something that would allow me to blog one handed. My long term goal is that I can do more than just blog with this tool. I have ideas about using it for many one page web apps.

# Extensible?
